"""
This is an example DAG which uses SparkKubernetesOperator and SparkKubernetesSensor.
In this example, we create two tasks which execute sequentially.
The first task is to submit sparkApplication on Kubernetes cluster(the example uses spark-pi application).
and the second task is to check the final state of the sparkApplication that submitted in the first state.

Spark-on-k8s operator is required to be already installed on Kubernetes
